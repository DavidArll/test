  # Performance option:
  # You can move the Apache logs to another partition or drive to
  # get some small increases in disk i/o on heavily loaded servers.
  # You can symlink the log files to /var/www/example.com/logs/
  # to keep the persistent user interface, however it doesn't work in
  # chroot environments.
